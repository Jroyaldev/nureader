## 3. Core Process

### Main User Flow

**Standard Reading Flow:**
1. User opens EPUB → System analyzes content and calculates optimal pagination
2. Reader chooses navigation mode (chapter-based or page-based)
3. User navigates through content using swipe, click, or keyboard
4. System maintains reading position across both navigation modes
5. Progress tracking updates in real-time for both page and chapter levels

**Advanced User Flow:**
1. Power users access pagination settings → Customize page layout preferences
2. System applies custom settings → Recalculates pagination dynamically
3. User enjoys personalized reading experience → Analytics track reading patterns
