# Testing the New EPUB Reader Implementation

## Overview
The EPUB reader has been migrated from a custom parser to the robust epubjs library. This fixes all parsing issues and simplifies navigation to chapter-based reading.

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Open the Application
Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser

### 3. Load an EPUB File
- Click the file upload button
- Select any EPUB file from your computer

### 4. Test Core Features

#### Navigation
- **Next/Previous Chapter**: Use arrow keys or swipe on mobile
- **Chapter Selection**: Click the menu icon to open Table of Contents
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - `←` / `→`: Previous/Next chapter
  - `Ctrl+T`: Open Table of Contents
  - `Ctrl+B`: Toggle bookmark
